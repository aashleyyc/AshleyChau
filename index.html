        <h2><span class="background">About Me!</span></h2>
            <img src="images/portfolio.jpg" style="width:245px;height:245px;" class="portfolio-img"> 
            <p><span class="highlight">Hello! My name is Ashley Chau and I am currently a senior at UCSD studying marine biology on the pre-veterinary path. I was initially only interested in pursing marine mammal veterinary, but through experiencing new practices and connecting with new people, I am now open to pursing a handful of new veterinary practices, such as large/farm animal, equine, exotics, and lab animal. I am passionate about wildlife and environemntal conservation, and I hope to use what I have learned and experienced to be able to positively influence others into caring about our planet as well. With both professional and personal experience with a diverse amount of species, I am always eager to gain more hands-on experience.</span></p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Student Intern at Pet Health Center of La Jolla</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">I am currently a student intern at the Pet Health Center of La Jolla, currently with almost over 200 hours of shadowing and experience under the veterinarian and veterinary technicians. Under their guidance I have developed skills in animal restraints, handling and administering medication along with advancing my knowledge of the field. I assist in surgical preperations and post operative care, blood draws and lab work, dental cleanings, appointments and physical examinations, gaining insight on clinical procedures. Beyond gaining insight and experience in a veterinary setting, I have learned of the tight community that our clinic has built with it's clients and their pets, which has deepened my understanding of what it means to be a successful veterinarian.</span> </p>
        <h3>Baby Bird Care Volunteer at Lindsay Wildlife Experience</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">As a senior in high school, I volunteered at the Lindsay Wildlife Experience caring for their baby birds. I gained experience in handling and care baby birds, portioning their meals, administering medication. My responsibilities also extended to aiding other volunteers and veterinarians in handling and restraining larger birds (raptors, crows, owls, etc.) and mammals (opposums, squirels, etc.), helping administer their medication and meals, cleaning their enclosures, along with maintaining general cleanliness around the facility (sweeping/mopping, cleaning dishes/organizing kitchen, laundry). This position allowed me to experience wildlife veterinary medicine and the important role they play in the recovery and rehabilitation of local wildlife that is often overlooked.</span></p>
        <h3>Shift Lead at Mochiholic</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">As a shift lead at Mochiholic, I was resonsible for the store when a manager was not present, including aiding my peers and assisting customers. I was also responsible for cleaning and organizing the kitchen, and preparing food for the next shift up to safety and sanitation standards. While not directly related to veterinary medicine, this position allowed me to further develop and strengthen my interpersonal skills, time managements, problem solving and conflict resolution, skills that are important in suceeding as a veterinarian working within a team and with peers.</span></p>
        <h3>Active Member of Pre-Veterinary Student Association at UCSD</h3>
            <p><span class="highlight">I am currently an active member of the Pre-Veterinary Student Association at UCSD, where I connect with different peers during club meetings and different events. Through this club, I have learned of a lot new practices and specialties within veterinary medicine and connected with those already in the field, both of which have provided a lot of new insight into navigating and succeeding in veterinary medicine.</span></p>
        <h2>Skills & Certifications</h2>
        <h3>Pet CPR Certification</h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_3076.jpg" class="cpr-img">
            <p><span class="highlight">I was recently certified for Pet CPR on both cats and dogs through Pet4CPR and UCSD PVSA. Through this workshop, I learned how to properly deliver CPR to dogs and cats of different sizes, along with how to treat a multitude of different wounds ranging from choking and bleeding to gunshot wounds and larger wounds. This course was insightful treating pets effectively and efficiently. </span></p>
